# rummy-mobile

A mobile port of my [gin rummy scoresheet](https://github.com/TomGower/rummy-scoresheet), written
as an exercise in learning mobile development with React Native and Expo.

Current status:

- Business logic working as intended
- Minimal styling
- Resolved as of Mar. 2, 2021: TextInput content from score updater now does reset on submit
- Future goals include improving styling and refactoring player score displays into clickable pages
