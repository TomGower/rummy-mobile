A mobile port of my [gin rummy scoresheet](https://github.com/TomGower/rummy-scoresheet), written
as an exercise in learning mobile development with React Native and Expo.

Current status:
- Business logic working as intended
- Minimal styling
- Largest current issue: TextInput content from score updater does not reset on submit
- Future goals include improving styling and refactoring player score displays into clickable pages
